	<h2>Question/Answer</h2>

	<p>Q.1) What is Charge ?</p>
	<p>Ans.) In physics, charge, also known as electric charge, electrical charge, or electrostatic charge and symbolized q, 
	is a characteristic of a unit of matter that expresses the extent to which it has more or fewer electrons than protons.
	In atoms, the electron carries a negative elementary or unit charge; the proton carries a positive charge. 
	The two types of charge are equal and opposite..
	</p><br><br>
	<p>Q.2) How much positive and negative charge is there in a cup of water ?</p>
	<p>Ans.) If the water is pure and the cup is neutral the net charge is zero by Newtonian physics.

But in quantum mechanics that's another story! At the subatomic level charge states are constantly collapsing and expanding depending on a myriad of factors.
 Statistically over time it all balances out, but at any particular instant the perceived charge can vary depending
